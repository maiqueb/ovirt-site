# What is the VM Portal?

Desktop virtualization provides users with a desktop environment that is similar to a personal computer’s desktop environment. The VM Portal delivers Virtual Desktop Infrastructure to users. Users access the VM Portal through a web browser to display and access their assigned virtual desktops. The actions available to a user in the VM Portal are set by a system administrator. Standard users can start, stop, and use desktops that are assigned to them by the system administrator. Power users can perform some administrative actions. Both types of users access the VM Portal from the same URL, and are presented with options appropriate to their permission level on login. 

**Standard User Access**

Standard users can power their virtual desktops on and off and connect to them through the VM Portal. Direct connection to virtual machines is facilitated with SPICE or VNC clients. Both protocols provide the user with an environment similar to a locally installed desktop. The administrator specifies the protocol used to connect to a virtual machine at the time of the virtual machine’s creation.

**Power User Access**

System administrators can delegate some administration tasks by granting users power user access. In addition to the tasks that can be performed by standard users, power users can:

* Create, edit, and remove virtual machines

* Manage virtual disks and network interfaces

* Assign user permissions to virtual machines

* Create and use templates to rapidly deploy virtual machines

* Monitor resource usage and high-severity events

* Create and use snapshots to restore virtual machines to previous states
