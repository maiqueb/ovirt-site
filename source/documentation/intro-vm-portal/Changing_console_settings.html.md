# Changing console settings

**Note:** The `Console` settings may be changed by any user who has permission to view the virtual machine. The changes are stored locally in the browser, not on the server.

**Changing console settings**

1. In the virtual machines pane, click the virtual machine name to go to the details view.

2. Click the **Console** settings icon (![](images/Edit_blue.png)) to access the following options:

   * **Connect automatically**: Enables you to connect automatically if only one virtual machine is running.
   * **Fullscreen**: Opens the virtual machine console in full screen automatically when you connect to the virtual machine. Press `SHIFT + F11` to toggle full screen mode on or off. 
   * **Use Ctrl+Alt+Del**: Maps the `Ctrl+Alt+End` key combination to `Ctrl+Alt+Del` inside the virtual machine. 
   * **Smartcard enabled**: Allows you to pass the smartcard from your client machine to the virtual machine.
