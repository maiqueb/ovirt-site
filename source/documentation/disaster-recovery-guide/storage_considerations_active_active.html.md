# Storage Considerations

The storage domain for Red Hat Virtualization can be made of either block devices (SAN - iSCSI or FCP) or a file system (NAS - NFS, GlusterFS, or other POSIX compliant file systems). For more information about Red Hat Virtualization storage see [Storage](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_virtualization/4.1/html-single/administration_guide/#chap-Storage) in the *Administration Guide*.

The sites require synchronously replicated storage that is writeable on both sites with shared layer 2 (L2) network connectivity. The replicated storage is required to allow virtual machines to migrate between sites and continue running on the siteâ€™s storage. All storage replication options supported by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and later can be used in the stretch cluster.

IMPORTANT: If you have a custom multipath configuration that is recommended by the storage vendor, copy the .conf file to the `/etc/multipath/conf.d/` directory. The custom settings will override settings in the VDSMs `multipath.conf` file.  Do not modify the VDSM file directly.
