## Chapter 2: Analyzing Metrics

Kibana offers two ways of analyzing metrics:

* [Build your own visualizations](../Creating_a_New_Visualization) such as charts, graphs, and tables.
* [Load and use predefined sets of visualizations](../Using_the_Dashboard)

Red Hat suggests that you start off by using the predefined visualizations. Each set is known as a _dashboard_. Dashboards have the advantage of enabling you to quickly access a wide range of metrics while offering the flexibility of changing them to match your individual needs.
